    <div class="inarticle">RWD (Responsive Web Design) - it's a method of designing websites which allows users to open the website on almost every device. Being more specific; website developer adds special layout tags which make website adapt to screen size. These collect informations about users' screen size and give them to HTML variables such as element width or height. It's based on simple math; HTML takes the viewport width (let's say 1440 pixels) and if the content is supposed to take 50% of screen widht, it shrinks it to 720 pixels. If the width of viewport is less than 720 pixels, a web developer can set it as a variable for smartphones (they usually have about this width) to make it appear differently for smartphones (because not every element of website could fit on the screen). <br><br>
    This site can be an example, can you see those elements next to this text (btw. they do nothing, it's just for you to see how it works)? If you change your viewport or visit this site on a smartphone you can see that the layout changes.</div>
